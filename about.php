                Graphic Era Deemed to be University is the culmination of the hard work of its visionary founder, Prof.
                (Dr.) Kamal Ghanshala, who had the dream to change the destiny of thousands of youths through quality
                and holistic education. In 1993, he embarked on the mission to transform the higher education landscape
                of the Doon Valley with twenty-nine thousand rupees in his pocket and loads of determination and
                tenacity in his heart, and started off with Graphic Era Computer Centre, developing software and
                delivering trainings on Computer Graphics. His vision gained concrete shape in 1997 in the form of
                Graphic Era Institute of Technology (GEIT).
