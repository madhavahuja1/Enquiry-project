    Academic Scholarship
The Fee Structure at Graphic Era (Deemed to be University), clearly mentions the Academic Scholarships provided in all courses defined in various categories based on the merit of the candidate obtained in the qualifying examination considered for admission into that specific course.
The Academic Scholarships provided in the Fee Structure has been defined for the entire course duration. The Scholarship bracket availed by the candidate at the time of the admission is frozen for the entire duration of the course. There is no change in the scholarship amount during the course, however the candidate will have to score a minimum aggregate of 7 SGPA, in order for the scholarship to applied in each semester. For candidates who fail to score 7 SGPA or above in any of the semesters, the scholarship will not be applicable for that particular semester. If the candidate is able to score 7 SGPA or above in the subsequent semester(s), the scholarship will be reinstated.
The fee structure clearly mentions the amount of the Academic Scholarship available to candidates or the entire course duration. This amount remains fixed for the entire course duration.
There are a number of other scholarships/concessions that the candidates might be eligible for – please do not confuse this with the Academic Scholarship – the amounts for this are mentioned clearly under the head “Academic Scholarship” in the Fee Structures corresponding to all courses.
